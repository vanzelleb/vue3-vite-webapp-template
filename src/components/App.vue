      BERTRAM And I in going, madam, weep o’er my father’s death anew: but I
      must attend his majesty’s command, to whom I am now in ward, evermore in
      subjection. LAFEU You shall find of the king a husband, madam; you, sir, a
      father: he that so generally is at all times good must of necessity hold
      his virtue to you; whose worthiness would stir it up where it wanted
      rather than lack it where there is such abundance. COUNTESS What hope is
      there of his majesty’s amendment? LAFEU He hath abandoned his physicians,
      madam; under whose practises he hath persecuted time with hope, and finds
      no other advantage in the process but only the losing of hope by time.
      COUNTESS This young gentlewoman had a father,–O, that ‘had’! how sad a
      passage ’tis!–whose skill was almost as great as his honesty; had it
      stretched so far, would have made nature immortal, and death should have
      play for lack of work. Would, for the king’s sake, he were living! I think
      it would be the death of the king’s disease. LAFEU How called you the man
      you speak of, madam? COUNTESS He was famous, sir, in his profession, and
      it was his great right to be so: Gerard de Narbon. LAFEU He was excellent
      indeed, madam: the king very lately spoke of him admiringly and
      mourningly: he was skilful enough to have lived still, if knowledge could
      be set up against mortality.
